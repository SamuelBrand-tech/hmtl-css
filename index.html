                            <p>Hydroponics is used throughout the horticulture industry as an alternative means of growing—presenting a whole host of benefits when compared to growing in soil. Relying on using an inert medium like perlite, rockwool, or clay pellets, the premise is that roots are in direct contact with a nutrient solution while still getting oxygen from water provided by an electrical pump.</p>

                            <p>It's safe to say chocolate is the best thing on earth, right? No wait, cannabis is! In reality, cannabis-infused chocolate is perhaps one of the more perfect unions found in this world.
